My implementation of some popular algorithms and structures:
basic java collections   ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeMap.
sorters                  selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.
search algorithms        binary search, Dijkstra algorithm, closest substring match, graph traversal, knapsack problem (greedy and dinamic algorithms), k-nearest neighbours.
plus some others
