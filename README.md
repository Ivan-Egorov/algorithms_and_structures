My implementation of some popular algorithms and structures.
Basic java collections:   ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, TreeMap.
Sorters:                  selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort.
Search algorithms:        binary search, Dijkstra algorithm, closest substring match, graph traversal, knapsack problem (greedy and dinamic algorithms), k-nearest neighbours.
+ some others
